              Can the IRS Fresh Start Program stop wage garnishments and bank

              Self-employed individuals facing tax debt may benefit from the
              Fresh Start Program, as it provides flexible payment options and
              may reduce penalties. This is especially useful for those with
              fluctuating incomes, allowing them to manage tax liabilities in a
              way that fits their financial circumstances.

              How does the Offer in Compromise work under the Fresh Start

            <p class="py-4 px-6 mb-3" style="background-color: #f9f9f9">
              The Offer in Compromise (OIC) lets you settle your tax debt for
              less than the total amount owed. The IRS evaluates your income,
              assets, and expenses to determine an acceptable amount. You can
              apply using Form 656, but qualification depends on meeting
              specific criteria.

              Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status under the Fresh Start
              Program halts IRS collections temporarily if you can prove
              financial hardship. By submitting Form 433-F, you may qualify for
              CNC status, giving you time to manage your finances without the
              pressure of immediate collections.

              The IRS assesses eligibility based on your current financial
