          At Premier Tax Debt Solutions, we provide administrative and
          supportive services to help taxpayers navigate the IRS Fresh Start
          program and other tax-related issues. We do not offer legal advice or
          tax preparation, nor do we represent clients in legal matters. For tax
          or legal advice, we recommend consulting with a licensed tax
          professional, such as a CPA, Enrolled Agent, or tax attorney. Our
          services are designed to assist in navigating forms, completing
          applications, and facilitating communication with the IRS.

          it replace professional tax advice. We simplify the process of form
          completion but do not ensure IRS acceptance of the documents.

          minimum of 30 days. We provide confirmation of the submission through
          email once the documents have been sent. While we facilitate the
          document transmission process, it is the responsibility of the
          taxpayer to ensure that all forms are properly completed before
          submission. We are not responsible for any delays or issues that arise
          from the faxing process.

          professionals. Clients may choose to work with these partners at their
          discretion, and we do not guarantee specific outcomes through these

          assistive, we maintain a no refund policy. Our services aim to guide
          taxpayers through the IRS processes but do not guarantee specific
          outcomes. Since we provide a self-service approach with assistance,
          including working with low-income individuals, retirees, and those on
          SSI, our services are non-refundable once initiated.
