        <h3>What Is Expendable Income?</h3>
        <p>
          Expendable income, often confused with disposable income, is the money
          left after covering essential expenses like housing, utilities, and
          taxes. For many, this “extra” money becomes a stepping stone toward
          building wealth. By resolving tax liabilities with PTDSolutions,
          clients often find themselves with newfound expendable income—money
          they can now use to invest in their dreams.
